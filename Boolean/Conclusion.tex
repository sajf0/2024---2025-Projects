In conclusion of our research, we have acquainted ourselves with two important algebraic structures in mathematics: the Boolean ring and the Boolean algebra. Additionally, we have demonstrated key results related to them. We have observed how every Boolean ring is isomorphic to the ring of power sets, but not entirely so for Boolean algebras, where we have seen that only finite Boolean algebras possess this property.
